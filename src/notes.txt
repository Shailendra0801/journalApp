1. Maven is used to create build and manage dependencies.
    - Phases of build lifecycles:
        -> Validate: Validates the project is correct and all necessary information is available.
        -> Compile: Compiles the source code of the project.
        -> Test: Tests the compiled code using suitable unit testing framework. These test should not require the
                 code to be packaged or deployed.
        -> Package: Take the compiled code and package it in it's distributable format, such as JAR.
        -> Verify: Run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met.
        -> Install: Install the package into local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects.
        -> Deploy: Deploy the project.
